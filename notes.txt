Interesting to note that stack variables are represented as pointer types. So
`load`ing a stack variable results in a pointer dereference, because it's
dereferencing a pointer to the stack. Without doing some null pointer analysis,
this would mean we're doing a null check for every variable on the stack, which
can be a problem
